# Real-State-Price-Prediction

This project demonstrates a linear regression model used to predict real estate prices

## Features
- Dataset: [checkout here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction)
- Model: A linear regression model trained to predict house prices.
- Metrics: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualization: Visualizations of actual vs predicted prices and feature correlations with house prices.
- Model: A linear regression model trained to predict house prices.
- Metrics: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualization: Visualizations of actual vs predicted prices and feature correlations with house prices.

## Steps
### Data Preprocessing:

- Handle missing values.
- Normalize/scale the data if needed.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
### Model Training:

- A linear regression model is used to train on the training data.
### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared and MSE to check the performance.
### Visualization:

- Scatter plots are created to visualize the actual vs predicted prices.
- Correlation matrix to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
